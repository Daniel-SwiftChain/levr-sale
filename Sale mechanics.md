# How this sale works and why it works this way

## What is the $LEVR token?
* It is the token used to make governance descisions wrt the levr.ly DAO and it's LSP (long short pair) products.
* For all legal and practical purposes it is best to think of the token as only an obligation and not a promise of profit in any sense. If the token holders do not use the tokens to enact their wil by voting on proposals in the levr.ly DAO, nothing can be expected to
come of it.

* $LEVR is therefore the voting token of the member managed levr.ly DAO. 

## How does $LEVR come into existence?
* $LEVR comes into existence whenever someone purchases $LEVR from the LevrSale contract. 
* $LEVR doesn't only go to the $LEVR buyer, whenever some purchases, 40% of the amount minted goes to the buyer. 25% goes to the the liquidity pools which back $LEVR and 25% goes to the levr.ly governance treasury for use by the DAO to fund projects. 5% goes to the Foundry DAO for spawning $LEVR and 5% goes either to the person who referred the buyer or to the treasury. 

## Where does the Ether go?
* 95% of the Ether goes to permanently locked liquidity. 
* 5% goes towards buying back and buring Foundry governance tokens as a reward for spawning levr.ly and the dEth project.

## What is permanently locked liquidity?
* 95% of the Ether received for every buy and 25% of the $LEVR issued at every purchase is sent to a set of high fee liqudity pools.
* The pools are equally split among:
  * $LEVR/$ETH 
  * $LEVR/$DAI 
  * $LEVR/$dETH
* These pools ensure that there is always an exist market for $LEVR tokens.
* The fact that the prices of Ether will vary and range over time ensure that the pools will generate some fee income, even in the total absence of any productive levr.ly actions. 
  * The extent of this income may range widely and not conserve the initial dollar or Ether value of the token and no guarentees are provided.
  * We do however encourage interested parties to investigate how high fee pools have performed historically in terms of fees and impermanent loss.
* This ensures that even if all $LEVR tokens are sold back to the AMM pools, that a "minimum possible price" for the tokens will be maintained.
* The high fee should not discourage secondary market activity as it leaves a wide price range within which other liquidity providers can operate. 

## How does the $LEVR curve work?
* The $LEVR sale curve is a pure linear curve that simply increases the price at which it mints new tokens based on how much it has already raised. This ensures that no one can mint $LEVR tokens cheaper than an earlier participant in the sale.
* The sale may at times offer a price higher than the secondary market 

## When will the token launch on DEXes?
* Immediately, 95% of all funds raised go directly towards DEX liqudity.
* Since Ethereum is an open system, anyone in posession of $LEVR tokens can participate in any available secondary market. 

## What is the $LEVR vesting period?
* 0, all tokens are available the moment they are purchased.
