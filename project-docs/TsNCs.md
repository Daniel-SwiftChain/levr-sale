I am an adult capable of making your own decisions, evaluating your own risks and engaging with others for mutual benefit. 
levr.ly and/or LEVR are extremely experimental and could enter into several failure modes. 
levr.ly and/or LEVR could fail technically through a software vulnerability.
While levr.ly and/or LEVR have been thuroughly tested, bugs may have nonetheless snuck through. 
levr.ly and/or LEVR could fail due to an economic attack, the details of which might not even be suspected at the time of launch. 
The projects that levr.ly funds may turn out to be flawed technically or have economic attack vectors that make them infeasible. 
LEVR, and the projects funded by levr.ly, might never find profitable returns. 
You will not hold the creators of this autonomous code liable for damages or losses. 
Even if you did, they will be unlikely to have the resources to settle. 
ETH deposited into this will be held in variety of smart contracts, which no one has direct control over, but may also betechnically flawed. 
I agree levr.ly may track anonymized data about my interactions with the sale. 
Entering ETH into the sale is irrevocable, you will have to sell your LEVR into whatever is on offer on the secondary market.
US citizens and residents are strictly prohibited from this sale.
